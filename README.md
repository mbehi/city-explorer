City Explorer is an app that lets users see information about a city.

## Getting Started

<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->
To get started, you will need a LocationIQ API key in a `.env` file to be able to run this app on your machine.

This app uses React on the frontend, with Bootstrap for styling and Axios for API requests. 

## Change Log
